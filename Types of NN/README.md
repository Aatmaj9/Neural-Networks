# Types of Neural Networks
There are seven types of neural networks that can be used.

Feedforward Networks: A feedforward neural network is a simple artificial neural network architecture in which data moves from input to output in a single direction.

Singlelayer Perceptron: A single-layer perceptron consists of only one layer of neurons . It takes inputs, applies weights, sums them up and uses an activation function to produce an output.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): MLP is a type of feedforward neural network with three or more layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. It uses nonlinear activation functions.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized artificial neural network designed for image processing. It employs convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical features from input images, enabling effective image recognition and classification.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): An artificial neural network type intended for sequential data processing is called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It is appropriate for applications where contextual dependencies are critical such as time series prediction and natural language processing, since it makes use of feedback loops which enable information to survive within the network.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM is a type of RNN that is designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in training RNNs. It uses memory cells and gates to selectively read, write and erase
